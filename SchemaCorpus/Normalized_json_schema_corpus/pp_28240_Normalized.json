The default_literal would be omitted for the following cases: 1) The primitive Puppet value has no direct translation into a JSON primitive type (for example, a regular expression, default, or undef).  2) The value contains a Puppet hash - either top-level or nested under another array or hash - with at least one key that is not a string.  3) The value contains one or more expressions that would have to be evaluated at catalog compilation time in order for the actual default value to be determined.
