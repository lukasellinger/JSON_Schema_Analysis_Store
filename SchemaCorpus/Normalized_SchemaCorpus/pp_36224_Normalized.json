For example, the part of speech for a lexeme might be given as both English *noun* and Spanish *nombre*. Each key must be a valid IETF language tag for a language (see the [IETF](https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/) reference page), and the value for that key must be the string of text in that language. **Note:** MultiLangStrings do not have a `type` property.\n\nIf the text is in only one language and that language is English, it may be represented as a simple string instead of an object.
